# Satellite Image Stitching

## Overview
This project aims to stitch together multiple satellite images to create a seamless mosaic. The process involves reading the images from a specified directory, stitching them together using OpenCV, and saving the resulting mosaic image. This can be particularly useful in applications related to remote sensing, where a larger geographical area needs to be visualized as a single image.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python-headless`
- `gdal`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python-headless gdal
```

## Folder Structure
- **images-data/**: A directory containing the satellite images you wish to stitch.
- **mosaic.tif**: The output mosaic image, generated by the script.

## How to Run

1. **Mount Google Drive (Optional, for Google Colab Users):**
   If you are running this project in Google Colab and your images are stored in Google Drive, use the following code to mount your drive:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

2. **Update Folder Path:**
   Set the `folder_path` variable to the directory where your satellite images are stored:
   ```python
   folder_path = "/path-to-your-images-data"
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   The script will iterate over all the images in the specified directory, read them, and attempt to stitch them together into a mosaic:
   ```python
   import cv2
   import numpy as np
   from osgeo import gdal
   import os

   # Load and preprocess images
   image_paths = []
   for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
       if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(folder_path, file)):
           image_paths.append(os.path.join(folder_path, file))

   # Read images
   images = [cv2.imread(path) for path in image_paths]

   # Stitch images
   stitcher = cv2.Stitcher_create()
   status, mosaic = stitcher.stitch(images)

   if status == cv2.Stitcher_OK:
       cv2.imwrite("mosaic.tif", mosaic)
       print("Mosaic created and saved.")
   else:
       print("Error during stitching:", status)
   ```

4. **Output:**
   - If the stitching is successful, the mosaic will be saved as `mosaic.tif` in the current working directory.
   - The error status code will be printed for troubleshooting if the process fails.

## Notes
- **Image Alignment:** This script assumes that the images are already aligned. If your images are not aligned, additional preprocessing will be required.
- **Performance:** The performance of the stitching process can vary depending on the size and number of images.

## Future Improvements
- Adding support for image alignment.
- Handling different image formats and projections.
- Implementing parallel processing for faster execution.
